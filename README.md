# Form-CrÃ©ation
A genuine place to create high quality forms with full functionality of what one could need. It is here where you get full customization according to the demands. User can create forms with variety of different options - text, radio, checkbox. The creator of the form gets to see the submission as it happens. 
One can also close the submission for the form if thats what one wants. 


The Form-CrÃ©ation is created using React as front-end and Django as backend. The Database used is Postgres. The web-app is deployed at our endearing Heroku.
